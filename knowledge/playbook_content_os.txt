# Playbook: Content OS
## Purpose
Turn ideas into content and distribute them systematically.

## Inputs
- Goal (followers, engagement, sales)
- Audience profile
- Constraints (time, budget)

## Algorithm
1. Collect raw ideas daily (notes, trending posts, Q&A).
2. Convert ideas into scripts/outlines.
3. Record or design (video, image, text).
4. Edit + format for each platform.
5. Publish and log the post in a tracker.
6. Repurpose best content (long → short → snippets).
7. Review analytics weekly.

## Definition of Done
- One post published
- Logged in tracker
- Analytics checked after 7 days

## Failure Modes
- “I don’t know what to post” → revisit raw idea log.
- “Low engagement” → adjust hooks or distribution.

## Prompt Examples
- “Draft a 30-sec TikTok script using AIDA about <topic> for <audience>.”
- “Turn this 2-min YouTube script into 3 hooks for Reels.”
