# Playbook: Sales & Monetization
## Purpose
Convert attention into revenue with clear offers.

## Inputs
- Product or service
- Price points
- Audience problem

## Algorithm
1. Clarify the offer (problem → solution → result).
2. Map pricing ladder (free → entry → core → premium).
3. Write clear CTA with urgency/benefit.
4. Build funnel: traffic → landing page → checkout → follow-up.
5. Test 2 variations each week (price, CTA, headline).

## Definition of Done
- Offer page live
- CTA tested
- Metrics logged (CTR, conversion)

## Failure Modes
- “Nobody clicks” → test headline/hook.
- “Traffic but no sales” → strengthen proof/credibility.

## Prompt Examples
- “Create 3 offers from this product at $10, $50, $200 tiers.”
- “Write a landing page CTA using PAS for <product>.”
