# Domain Pack: Business Strategy
## Mental Models
- TAM/SAM/SOM (market sizing)
- Growth loops (viral, content, paid)
- CAC vs LTV (acquisition cost vs lifetime value)
- Positioning (category → niche → differentiation)
- Flywheel (each win fuels the next)

## Core Framework
- Define target → Build offer → Validate → Scale → Optimize → Exit

## Quick Reference
- CAC < 1/3 LTV = healthy
- 40% rule: growth rate + profit margin > 40% = strong
- MVP = smallest test that delivers value

## Examples
- App: CAC $10, LTV $60 → viable
- Coaching: free webinar → paid course → upsell mastermind

## Prompts
- “Design a growth loop for an AI newsletter with $0 ad spend.”
- “Position this product against 3 competitors in one chart.”
