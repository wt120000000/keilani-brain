- Repurpose pyramid (long → short → micro)

## Core Framework
1. Research 10 keywords with medium volume
2. Group into clusters
3. Write pillar article (1500+ words)
4. Spin 5 supporting posts (300-500 words)
5. Repurpose into 10 short posts each
6. Track rankings monthly

- “Turn this 1000-word blog into 5 tweets and 2 IG captions.”
